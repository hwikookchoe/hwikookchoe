- [Understanding Forward-Looking Behavior using Dynamic Discrete Choice and Rational Addiction Model: Application to California Cigarette Tax Increase](https://github.com/hwikookchoe/hwikookchoe/blob/main/Hwikook%20Choe_JMP.pdf)

    Consumer's forward-looking behavior can create change in current purchase and consumption in response to the change in expectation on future price. Using cigarette tax increase in California as exogenous variation, I found peak in purchase right before the actual price increase and plunge after the increase. Using dynamic discrete choice model with rational addiction and stockpiling, I found that change in the timing of tax increase announcement can incur change in consumer's steady state of consumption in the long run.


- [Competition between First-party and Third-party Sellers on Online Platforms](https://github.com/hwikookchoe/hwikookchoe/blob/main/Project_DD.pdf)

    Online platforms are two-sided markets which match two different sides of agents: buyers and sellers and earn profits by matching them. However, recent platforms sell their own goods or services that directly competes with the sellers on the platform. Whether increasing profit by selling first-party products and competing with third-party sellers on the platform is questionable. By using online bookstore data, I investigate the consumers choice on first-party and third-party sellers.
