- [Understanding Forward-Looking Behavior using Dynamic Discrete Choice and Rational Addiction Model: Application to California Cigarette Tax Increase](https://github.com/hwikookchoe/hwikookchoe/blob/main/Hwikook%20Choe_JMP.pdf)
Consumer's forward-looking behavior can create change in current purchase and consumption in response to the change in expectation on future price. Using cigarette tax increase in California as exogenous variation, I found peak in purchase right before the actual price increase and plunge after the increase. Using dynamic discrete choice model with rational addiction and stockpiling, I found that change in the timing of tax increase announcement can incur change in consumer's steady state of consumption in the long run.
